## World Happiness Analysis


The aim of the project is to find out and analyze which countries are happier and which social and economic reasons lead to the people of a country being happy and contentful.



THe datasets are donwloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness/data). We have datasets for the years 2015, 2016and 2017. I also want to check that how does the happiness of a country has  changes over the course of 3 years.



### Reading the datasets


```{r ,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}

year_2015<-read.csv(file = "2015.csv")
year_2016<-read.csv(file = "2016.csv")
year_2017<-read.csv(file = "2017.csv")

remove_col<-function(df,x)
{
  df[,x]<-NULL
  df #returns a updated dataframe with removed column X
  
}
